# JavaFX Calculator Application
The main goal of the project is getting familiar with JavaFX and practicing Java programming language.
It's a simple calculator app that lets the user to imput a mathematical operation string, not allowing to input an incorrect string.  
The absolute value parentheses are represented by [] symbols, to make the operations easier to read for both the user and the interpreter.
The n-th root of x is represented as nâˆšx.
